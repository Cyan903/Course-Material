# Course-Material
Paid course content and code. I usually don't do paid courses so that's why I don't have a repository like this.
Old courses are not added. I've started using Github and storing my progress on `2021/09/20`.

Current Courses:
* Vue.js [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)]
